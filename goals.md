The goal is for this library to have an intuitive interface for working with 
n dimensional/tensor data, while interfacing with libraries like Polars, and 
by proxy plotly-rs. It should have linear algebra functionality, and integration
with argmin-rs for optimization. It should have common statistical functions 
such that it is able to work in a statistical computing environment.
